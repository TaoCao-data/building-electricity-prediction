Building load prediction

This repo is a code for building load prediction project. It is a light demo version of the
complete code. The complete code develops a data driven tool for general purpose building electricity load prediction. The tool is built upon LSTM on Keras.

If you are interested to learn more about the work, you can either check the demo via (Insert Heroku website) or send me a message via GitHub.
